								<h2><span></span><span class="line"><span></span></span> </h2>

								The Policy is designed to tell you how we collect and use personal information (as defined below) so you can make an informed decision about using our Site and the Find X service. Please read this statement before submitting any personal information to us. By using our Site and service, you represent that you consent to the information collection and use practices described herein. <br/>
								</br>
                                                                <h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>

                                                                Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use the various services and activities available through the Find X Site and service. At several places on our Site or within our mobile application, we may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information.

In addition, from time to time we may collect contact or other personal or demographic information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys or promotional offers. <br/>
								</br>When turned on and with an active Find X, the Find X app will automatically collect location information from your mobile device and/or your mobile carrier. When you use the service, via your mobile device, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the application and through the service. We treat this information as personal information. Unless you direct us to act otherwise, your personal location information is anonymized. From this point onwards, it is used in the aggregate only. If you no longer wish to allow us to collect and use your location information, you may discontinue the use of the service.<br/>

For example, we may use the information we collect:
